# Breaking Point

Breaking Point is a fast-paced, top-down shooter game built using Unreal Engine 5. This project was developed as part of a game design and Unreal Engine course. The game combines intense combat mechanics with a dark, mission-driven narrative where players take on the role of a mercenary completing high-stakes missions.

## Features
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: 
  - Mission-focused levels with enemy clearing objectives.
  - Bullet-time mechanic for strategic combat.
  - Dynamic enemy AI with melee and ranged attack patterns.
- **Level Design**: 
  - Oda-based progression within multi-level structures like mansions.
  - Players must clear all enemies in each room to progress.
- **Boss Fights**: 
  - Unique bosses, each inspired by animal masks (e.g., Rabbit, Crow, Snake, Wolf), with distinct combat styles.
- **Music and Audio Design**:
  - Fast-paced metal tracks during gameplay, ambient sounds for menus and cutscenes.
  - High-quality sound effects, including bullet impacts, enemy screams, and dynamic audio changes in bullet-time.

## Platforms
- **Target Platform**: PC
- **Game Engine**: Unreal Engine 5

## Project Status
This is a **prototype** and not a complete game. The project demonstrates core gameplay mechanics, level progression, and enemy behavior. While fully playable, additional polishing and features would be necessary for a full release.

## Repository Note
Due to GitHub's file size limitations, some larger project files and directories (e.g., `DerivedDataCache`, `Intermediate`, `Saved`) are not included in this repository. These files are not essential for understanding the code or core functionality, as Unreal Engine can regenerate them. However, for a complete project setup, please download the full project files from the following link:
